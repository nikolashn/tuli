Tuli - Terribly Useless Language for Integers

Tuli is a machine code language based on base -2 integers and a few instructions. This repository is a virtual machine for running Tuli code. Hopefully one day we will be able to get a fully-featured Tuli CPU.

Here is a Hello World program in Tuli:
```
crcrrcrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrovvrrrccrrrrrcrrcrcrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroLccccccccccccccccccc
ccccoolccccccccccccccoucrcrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrorcrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrcccolccccccc
cccccccocccolcccccccccccccccccccccccoucrrrcrrcrcrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroucrrrrrcrcrrrrrrrrrrrrr

```

## Installation

Requires GNU make and a C compiler. Modify config.mk to change the C compiler and C compiler flags.
